# Implementation of "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space"

This project implements the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Continuous Skip-gram models described in the paper "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" by Tomas Mikolov et al.

## Week 1-2: Understanding and Setting Up

- **Reading and Understanding the Paper**
  - Thoroughly read the paper.
  - Note key mathematical formulations and algorithms.

- **Environment Setup**
  - Set up development environment with Python, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow/PyTorch.
  - Install Git and set up a GitHub account.

- **Initial Implementation**
  - Implement CBOW model.
  - Write script for text preprocessing (tokenization, vocabulary, training examples).

## Week 3-4: Implementing CBOW and Skip-gram Models

- **Implement CBOW Model**
  - Implement forward pass of CBOW.
  - Implement backward pass and update rules using SGD.
  - Test with a small dataset.

- **Implement Skip-gram Model**
  - Implement forward pass of Skip-gram.
  - Implement backward pass and update rules using SGD.
  - Test with a small dataset.

- **Evaluation and Validation**
  - Evaluate models using word similarity tasks.
  - Compare results to ensure meaningful word representations.

## Week 5-6: Optimization and Experimentation

- **Optimizing Hyperparameters**
  - Experiment with learning rate, batch size, epochs, vector dimensions.
  - Train on a larger dataset.

- **Implementing Improvements**
