# Implementation of "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" from a different perspective

This project is our implementation of the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Continuous Skip-gram models described in the paper "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" by Tomas Mikolov et al.

## Week 1-2: Understanding and Setting Up

- **Reading and Understanding the Paper**
  - The team will thoroughly read the paper.
  - We will note key mathematical formulations and algorithms.

- **Environment Setup**
  - The team will set up our development environment with Python, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow/PyTorch.
  - We will install Git and set up a GitHub account.

- **Initial Implementation**
  - The team will implement the CBOW model.
  - We will write a script for text preprocessing (tokenization, vocabulary, training examples).

## Week 3-4: Implementing CBOW and Skip-gram Models

- **Implement CBOW Model**
  - The team will implement the forward pass of CBOW.
  - We will implement the backward pass and update rules using SGD.
  - We will test with a small dataset.

- **Implement Skip-gram Model**
  - The team will implement the forward pass of Skip-gram.
  - We will implement the backward pass and update rules using SGD.
  - We will test with a small dataset.

- **Evaluation and Validation**
  - The team will evaluate the models using word similarity tasks.
  - We will compare results to ensure meaningful word representations.

## Week 5-6: Optimization and Experimentation

- **Optimizing Hyperparameters**
  - The team will experiment with learning rate, batch size, epochs, vector dimensions.
  - We will train on a larger dataset.

- **Implementing Improvements**
  - The team will implement hierarchical softmax or negative sampling.
  - We will fine-tune the models for better performance.

- **Preparing for Contribution**
  - The team will document the code thoroughly.
  - We will write tests for code correctness.

## Week 7-8: Finalization and Contribution

- **Final Testing and Documentation**
  - The team will conduct final tests.
  - We will prepare comprehensive documentation.

- **Creating a Pull Request**
  - The team will fork the original repository.
  - We will push changes to the forked repository.
  - We will create a detailed pull request.

- **Engaging with the Community**
  - The team will respond to feedback on the PR.
  - We will participate in repository discussions.
